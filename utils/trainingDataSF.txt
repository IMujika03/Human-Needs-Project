Current-borne, wave-flung, tugged hugely by the whole might of ocean, the jellyfish drifts in the tidal abyss. The light shines through it, and the dark enters it. Borne, flung, tugged from anywhere to anywhere, for in the deep sea there is no compass but nearer and farther, higher and lower, the jellyfish hangs and sways; pulses move slight and quick within it, as the vast diurnal pulses beat in the moon-driven sea. Hanging, swaying, pulsing, the most vulnerable and insubstantial creature, it has for its defense the violence and power of the whole ocean, to which it has entrusted its being, its going, and its will.

The Hegemony Consul sat on the balcony of his ebony spaceship and played Rachmaninoff's Prelude in C-sharp Minor on an ancient but well-maintained Steinway while great, green, saurian things surged and bellowed in the swamps below. A thunderstorm was brewing to the north. Bruise-black clouds silhouetted a forest of giant gymnosperms while stratocumulus towered nine kilometers high in a violent sky. Lightning rippled along the horizon. Closer to the ship, occasional vague, reptilian shapes would blunder into the interdiction field, cry out, and then brash away through indigo mists. The Consul concentrated on a difficult section of the Prelude and ignored the approach of storm and nightfall.

A beginning is the time for taking the most delicate care that the balances are correct. This every sister of the Bene Gesserit knows. To begin your study of the life of Muad’Dib, then, take care that you first place him in his time: born in the 57th year of the Padishah Emperor, Shaddam IV. And take the most special care that you locate Muad’Dib in his place: the planet Arrakis. Do not be deceived by the fact that he was born on Caladan and lived his first fifteen years there. Arrakis, the planet known as Dune, is forever his place.

There was a wall. It did not look important. It was built of uncut rocks roughly mortared. An adult could look right over it, and even a child could climb it. Where it crossed the roadway, instead of having a gate it degenerated into mere geometry, a line, an idea of a boundary. But the idea was real. It was important. For seven generations there had been nothing in the world more important than that wall.

By human standards it could not possibly have been artificial: It was the size of a world. But it was so oddly and intricately shaped, so clearly intended for some complex purpose that it could only have been the expression of an idea. Gliding in polar orbit about the great blue-white star, it resembled some immense, imperfect polyhedron, encrusted with millions of bowl-shaped barnacles. Every bowl was aimed at a particular part of the sky. Every constellation was being attended to. The polyhedral world had been performing its enigmatic function for eons. It was very patient. It could afford to wait forever.

Katherine knelt down and retrieved the hat, handed it over to Melissa. “You know, I used to have a hat kind of like this. It was a little too big for me, so I’d run into stuff all the time.  The trick is you’ve got to angle it up, like this.” She placed it on Melissa’s head slantways, the front brim almost perpendicular to the sky. “Plus, if you keep the brim away from your eyes, you can catch sight of a whale better.  Around here, you’re looking for a gray whale.  They leave big splashes that you can see from miles away, so watch the horizon. Or sometimes they’re sneaky, and do this thing called spy hopping, where they’ll just peek their heads out enough to see where they are. Watch for that too.”

The man in black fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed.  he desert was the apotheosis of all deserts, huge, standing to the sky for what looked like eternity in all directions. It was white and blinding and waterless and without feature save for the faint, cloudy haze of the mountains which sketched themselves on the horizon and the devil-grass which brought sweet dreams, nightmares, death. An occasional tombstone sign pointed the way, for once the drifted track that cut its way through the thick crust of alkali had been a highway. Coaches and buckas had followed it. The world had moved on since then. The world had emptied.

If a man walks in dressed like a hick and acting as if he owned the place, he’s a spaceman. It is a logical necessity.

Everything in the universe is older than it seems. Blame Einstein for that. We see what a thing was when the light left it, and that was long ago. Nothing in the night sky is contemporary, not to us, not to one another. Ancient stars exploded into ruin before their sparkle ever caught our eyes; those glimpsed in glowing "nurseries" were crones before we witnessed their birth. Everything we marvel at is already gone. Yes light rays go out forever, so that everything grown old and decayed retains somewhere the appearance of its youth. The universe is full of ghosts. But images are light, and light is energy, and energy is matter, and matter is real. So image and reality are the same thing, after all. Blame Einstein for that, as well.

The gods, too, make war upon each other. Two million years ago, it is said, the Ieldra defeated the Dark God and thus saved the Milky Way from the fate of Dichali and the Aud Spiral and other galaxies that have disappeared down the black hole of the gods' lust for the infinite. It is also said that the Ieldra have fused their souls into the light streaming out of the core of our galaxy, but other gods have evolved to replace them. There is Ai and Pure Mind and the April Colonial Intelligence and the One. And, of course, the greatest god of all, the Solid State Entity, She who had once been a woman named Kalinda of the Flowers.

Flipping through the subreddits, Shawn learned that some scientists who worked at the Large Hadron Collider had been experimenting with something called the Higgs Boson. Apparently, all around us is something called the Higgs Field. It is like an electromagnetic field that tells objects to take on just the right amount of mass. Acceleration or inertia are like two sides of the same coin. Energy is converted to mass at higher speeds. E=mc2. But what if the mass that pulls on us is increased? Across the board? That was what they were saying happened. The mass of the Earth and hence its gravity had increased.

It seemed that the great actors and creatures of the show were there before them in the flesh. The novelty of this toy for the rich which they’d ‘commandeered’ in their travels was gradually waning for Elise, but Trinity remained wide eyed and infatuated while her sister dozed off. Trinity remained fixated, lost in a childlike innocence while marvelling at the gamma tube weaving magic through the room.

For once having such a small ship came in handy and Elise was in the loading bay in no time. The pull of air leaking from the bay was significantly stronger than she expected. Space was reaching out for them and it soon hastened a grip on her. Elise fought with all her might to stay centred but the unbridled force of space was too much. She was sent hurtling towards the small yet catastrophic breach, like she’d been caught in the whipped frenzy of a cyclone. At the hapless mercy of the universe, she forced herself against the breach and tried to lower an emergency shutter over it to no avail. The rickety old shutter had seized in place and rusted to a halt. The pressure in the ship dipped dangerously low and Elise could feel her lips tingling. Blotches of black began blurring her vision, her breaths wheezed with fatigue and soon her hands felt numb. It was all lost.

Elise had heard all the accounts from the smugglers about near death experiences. They all sounded like mere stories, dramatic exaggerations or even full blown fabrications. Most of these smugglers had evidently been lying. Elise saw no glistening gates or gargantuan gleaming sky castles residing in a nest of stars as some described. Nor did she see herself dead as her formless consciousness escaped the vessel of her body. No, the truth was far less fluent or free-flowing.

Days passed where the two barely spoke. They could only think of one subject to talk about, and neither wanted to reminisce on it. They breezed by each other like ghosts, wondering how lucky they truly were to have come back. Ignorance is bliss, and there are certain pieces of knowledge in this life that we are simply not meant to know. They both felt like they had returned, but couldn’t help thinking they’d left something behind.
{26, 26, 20, 18, 5, 5}
;;;
Days faded into weeks. The Vendetta still trundled along the lengthy, mundane trail to its drop-off planet, Earth. Rumours and wives tales said that Earth was the first planet humans lived on, but Elise (like many others) wasn’t sold on the idea. Earth was nothing more than an isolated outer rim planet, reserved for its off the books trading and fugitive gangs these days. It was the faded jewel upon this rusted necklace of a system, surrounded by a plethora of failed colonies and mining ventures. The sisters spoke about the odd nature of Earth often, and today was no exception.

Elise was within a few paces of the hooded stowaway who kept bounding down the walkway with heavy footsteps. In a moment of pure instinct, Elise leapt through the air and tackled them to the ground. They struggled and fought but couldn’t find their feet. Elise pelted them into submission with a swift knee to the ribs then yanked the hood back.
{28, 24, 20, 18, 5, 5}
;;;
The world around Elise imploded in a blink, delusion collapsed into shattering reality and she found herself floating in space. Trapped in her spacesuit with The Vendetta nowhere in sight, she was still holding the unsuited, frozen dead body of Trinity in her arms. She remembered now. They had been flushed out the ship as she reboarded from the exterior maintenance job. She’d been meaning to fix the airlock for weeks, but it was too late now.

A police transport zipped by overhead just above seasonal signs that read, in most cases, the generic “Happy Holidays.” Larken Marche leveraged her laser swordspear to keep her upright as she crunched through the knee-deep snow that covered most of 56th street. She glared at the whiteness covering the streets below, bringing to a freeze all of the normally bustling commerce, and more importantly, passable walkways and streets in the dregs. She pulled her cloak more tightly around her shoulders and watched her breath mist before her in dismay. There was no way that her ragtag group could make it through the sludge, and it would be a week or more before it would be passable again.
{28, 24, 20, 18, 5, 5}
;;;
The gust of wind from the police vehicle’s wake knocked snow free of the interconnected canopy overhead and sent flakes drifting down around Larken’s black ringlets, occasionally landing on her Nubian nose or over-glossed lips. The augmented reality glasses she wore told her that the snow was almost two feet deep in some places, and of uneaven densities. Without clearing first, the route would be impassible, and with clearing, there went their element of surprise.

The Liberti group had taken over a failed bank on the corner of second and Hawthorne for their new Portland headquarters and she wasn’t close to there yet. She hadn’t even crossed over the Willamette yet from the East side of the city, and already she had difficulty walking. She examined the perimeter for any way they might be able to go forward when she caught a glint in the distance. Larken thought she saw an outline of a woman so familiar that she had to glance at it twice. The second glance, though offered her no more clarity as the sheen of the snow washed out everything except for the woman’s vague outline, which she acknoweledged to herself could have as easily been a snowman.
{26, 26, 20, 18, 5, 5}
;;;
She turned and began to slough her way back to the cleaner streets farther up the hill on forty-third toward her makeshift temporary headquarters. The AR glasses chimed fifty feet before they caught up with her new direction, then the heartbreaking numbers rose before her: one hundred twenty feet back. Larken wouldn’t make it.

Dandelion shook her head. Long golden hair reflected in her green-gold eyes as it swirled around her face. Larken felt her breath stop, and willed her breathing to continue. This wasn’t Dandelion, she told herself. It wasn’t her love, only an imposter. An experiment.
{28, 24, 20, 18, 5, 5}
;;;
Larken closed her eyes as the words sank deep into her soul. She had become a killer, a transition that had happened over so many years that she’d almost not noticed it happening. But by now, she’d taken so many lives that she couldn’t deny the truth of Dandelion’s words. She couldn’t be upset about Dandelion’s propensity for violence when she’d left at least as many dead in her wake.
{28, 24, 20, 18, 5, 5}
;;;
The words would have meant more coming from someone who understood the implications, as Dandelion had already demonstrated that she didn’t. But that touch. Larken found herself inching forward. The snow fell more quickly now, like a tiny flurry had formed over their heads. She raised her gloved hand to Dandelion’s too-warm face, and found herself smiling as she traced Dandelion’s cheekbone.
{30, 22, 20, 18, 5, 5}
;;;
Dandelion wove her fingers into Larken’s and the two began a slow walk through the snow, larken in her boots and Dandelion barefoot in a sundress. The snow steamed whenever one of Dandelion’s feet touched, and the hand that Larken held slowly thawed her arm and sent heat radaiting through her body. She hadn’t realized just how cold she’d become.
{20, 28, 20, 20, 5, 7}
;;;
“Just for today,” she said, unwilling to trust yet that Dandelion had changed as much as she claimed. But she could try it out for one day, and see just how much of Dandelion was still in this extension copy, and whether the lessons learned had truly sunken in. In the meantime, though, she would push all of that from her mind. For right now, Larken would not be a revolutionary leader. Dandelion would not be the woman who’d tried to kill Larken’s former host body, and the two of them would be as they had once been: lovers, in a sleeping city that denied them nothing.

Then, earlier, Stacy was shouting with Genie in the street outside Jeremy’s apartment. Their hired Santa actor couldn’t make it, and Genie’s young daughter’s Christmas party had already started. Geni was incredibly wealthy, unlike Stacy, but also stingy, and her daughter was extraordinarily demanding. The place she lived in was similar to those around it and not quite lavish, despite her penthouse attitude. 
{30, 20, 20, 18, 6, 6}

Genie pushed her back inside and turned to Stacy. “Herpes or not, we need another Santa. You owe me, Stacy. I’m always paying for your shit. I know your last girlfriend didn’t turn out to be Princess Charming, and you’re searching for a replacement, but you haven’t paid your bills in months. That’s not sexy. Find yourself a sugar mama, Mama.”
{26, 24, 22, 16, 6, 6}

“All you need to do is sit down and put this headset on-” Jeremy said, handing her a steel skullcap attached to cables, “and picture in your head for a few seconds what you need—Santa, in this case—and where he should be. Then, I turn on the machine and wait as the company database processes your thoughts. Finally—I’m not totally sure how—your thought appears in the real world, roughly how and where you imagined.”
{28, 22, 20, 18, 6, 6}
;;;
Frozen puddles and sleet greeted them as they stepped into the icy air. “Rockin’ Around the Christmas Tree” boomed from a house a few blocks away, near Genie’s. Thick snow fell, and salt crunched under their feet as Stacy and Jeremy stayed close, slinking through the inky darkness between the dim streetlights. Genie answered the door angrily.

Stacy dashed back outside. The music had died. Some sort of commotion was happening at the other house. Genie cheered, and Stacy walked up to see what was going on. Instantly, she was horrified. Through the window was the Santa she had summoned—his face warped, and his skin discolored and yellow. He stood over a man he had just knocked out, his knuckles bloody, and a beer in his other hand—the same one from Jeremy’s apartment. The two neighbors and the other party-goers clutched grocery bags and hit him with them to no effect.

He guided his son to the dining room and returned alone. Peeking out, he sighed. On the table was a record player. He dropped the needle. “White” by Miles Davis played. It was a haunting piece with a signature shrill trumpet and ringing chimes. Eyes shut, he envisioned the surrounding world drowned in man’s hellfire. The part he had trouble picturing was what everything would look like afterward. Sticking up his thumb, the man opened one eye, looking out the window. The shock wave would soon arrive.

Michael opened the closet again. The clock read 6:33:04. Two milliseconds had already passed. He was running out of time. Michael’s knees buckled. His palm against the wall held him up as he stumbled to the bathroom and ran his face under the sink water. His usually neatly groomed, greying hair was in a tangle of disarray. It felt like his breath had escaped him as he loosened his collar. Top button undone, tie missing, and his pale face still soaked, he emerged into the golden haze of the dining room lights to a host of concerned faces.

The woman sent a photo of her holding her exposed breasts and smiling at the camera. On the table in the corner of the photo was a small picture of her with Chris. The caption in a colorful, whimsical font on the bottom of the frame read: Walt Disney World Family Trip!

Bianca fainted in Michael’s arms. He led the boys through the hall, the drawing room with the closet. He reached inside, pressing a button. A dank staircase emerged in the adjoining wall.

The beaming industrial lights flickered on, filling the concrete basement with a white, artificial glow. Josh stood in the corner beside an unassuming steel door, low to the ground, about five feet in height and width, nearly small enough to be a trapdoor. His right hand was on a power switch, and his phone was in his left hand, facing Michael and the boys. On it was a photo of Michael lying in his underwear on the couch upstairs beside a woman in lingerie—Ruth.

Turning to the wall behind him, Michael pressed his hand to the wall. It fell away, and inside was a clean, spacious, and well-lit room with chairs, a couch, and a bed. In the corner were rows of boxes labeled ‘Supplies.’ As he stepped inside, Michael looked back at the metal door his kids and wife were behind and observed his warped, nearly unrecognizable reflection. Slightly below, at the bottom of the door, was a small engraving beside a caution sign that read: U.S. Military Earthquake Shelter—DO NOT SUBJECT TO HIGH HEATS. Shutting the door, he could already hear their screams. His phone buzzed. It was Ruth again.

This time, Max tried some bay leaves and more thyme. Even had he known to remove the former at the final stage, he knew it was yet another fail.

At the same time, Indianapolis was likely to have a thriving beachfront trade about the time polar bears and flamingos roamed the Hoosier plains, if Russia and China and Hezbollah didn’t burn the whole joint first, so Max didn’t see ejecting maybe a half-gallon of seasoned stomach contents into the municipal sewage system creating sentient fish or turning America into the Hitlerian dystopia it might well be in another year, anyway.

She examined the opaque blue bowl. “You can’t even see what you’re eating, and they must be using cheaper plastic these days.

Do people have even an ounce of pride any more?” She glanced at the base of the container. “CHINA?? Well, no wonder.”

The smartass kid from Thai Paradise had had no idea what he’d gotten along with his shitty tip. Max realized everything he was, had become, but the whole thing would have had a Dahmeresque vibe — an unsavory aftertaste of racism and perversion, you should pardon the pun. He had standards, of a very relative sort. He had taken Grandma’s words to heart, but in the Information Age, in a service-based society, in the city, finding the right old-guard “stock” was more than a challenge – it was a potentially deadly proposition. Tanner had been a pothead, a slacker, but the cable guy was beefy and seemed like a hard if yappy worker, well-muscled and loose-jointed.

But apparently, Grandma’s thoughts had run to Grandpa — his whoppers and tall tales, his hearty pride returning triumphant from the hunt, his ultimately fatal betrayal of their vows with one not their own.

The visitor appeared as lightning – bright, fast, and with terrible noise, heralding their arrival to the Auvergne countryside with black scorch marks in a field of crops. On a cloudless, rainless night, it could be seen and heard for miles – but there was only one who noticed it, who peered out with tired eyes from his farmhouse window, shrugged it off, and went back to bed. The visitor, perhaps expecting a larger welcome, decided to wait.

Alexandre found them the next morning, completely by chance, after tending to the cows, and rearing the new calves. The visitor was strolling his small orchard, sampling apricots, hairless, naked, and bony. The farmer had never before seen anything so unbearably wretched. He said nothing when they met eyes, processing still how his guest could stand upright with those tiny, brittle limbs.
{23, 33, 24, 12, 5, 3}
;;;
And then, for some time, the visitor talked. They called themselves a “diplomat”, who had been sent to find exotic cuisines to bring back to the motherland. They spun tales of magnificent places and unbelievable dishes, of opulent feasts and unbridled pleasures, food of all forms from strange and distant lands. Alexandre wasn’t sure what to make of it, but they spoke with such conviction that he couldn’t help but be drawn into the stories. Suddenly, the backhanded compliment about the apricots meant much more coming from this strange, skinny thing. The longer he listened to the Diplomat talk about food, the more he himself became defensive about the quality of his produce, half-buried in the mud. And so, the moment they stopped talking, Alexandre invited them to his farmhouse for brunch.
{28, 30, 22, 12, 6, 2}
;;;
The Diplomat ignored the spoon set out for them, and instead immediately cupped the soup in their hands, getting carrots and onions and chunks of potato on the table and the hardwood floor, spitting and coughing as they stuffed fistfuls of vegetables and carefully seasoned broth into their hideous, gaping mouth. Alexandre struggled to hide his discomfort. Even as the Diplomat moved on from the bowl and begun eating directly out of the pot, the farmer was too wrapped up in finding out their opinion to comment on the mess. After all, such a display of gluttony was an undeniable endorsement of Alexandre’s cooking! Perhaps they expressed it in an unusual way, but surely, that expression was one of enjoyment?
{25, 32, 23, 12, 6, 2}
;;;
And they got more. Because Alexandre had more, stashed away in his large chest freezer. Over the next few hours, Alexandre would feed the Diplomat, and the Diplomat would ask for more. All they ate was meat, and it was every meat they ate - chicken, lamb, pork - but veal was their favourite, followed closely by beef. Alexandre darted between the rooms, preparing meat in every way he could think of – boiled, fried, minced, diced, all eaten indiscriminately by the ravenous consumer. Eventually, he stopped seasoning it. So long had Alexandre lived alone, it was a downright thrill to have somebody around who so enjoyed his company in this way.
{26, 30, 22, 13, 6, 3}
;;;
Overwhelmed, he begun to walk on autopilot. He left the kitchen. He passed through the wrecked dining room. He left the house, got in his truck, and drove to the nearest town. Whatever was happening, he could no longer deal with it. The Diplomat could eat all the meat he had – just as long as he didn’t have to watch. Alexandre could’ve told somebody, but he didn’t have the words for it. Instead, he sat in his truck, far away from the farm, and waited for sunrise.

Waking up with Rico never failed to cheer me. This was a sad day, but it would also be joyful. My whole family was coming to my house after the graveside ceremony to tell stories about Abuelita and eat food made from her recipes.

{34, 26, 19, 12, 6, 3}

But I started to wonder if I really was ok. Maybe I could’ve made more effort in that area. Were my standards too high? I thought back on old relationships, wondering if I may have struck them off too quickly. Were they truly that bad? Or was there something wrong with me?

I stretched out on my couch considering. Had I made a wrong choice somewhere along the line? At that moment, I was definitely feeling like I may have passed up an opportunity for a happily married life. And in the cool darkness of my apartment, the grief of my grandmother’s passing was sitting heavy on my heart. All my family had someone, for better for worse, to hold tonight to ease their sadness. And although Rico snuggled by me and was always there, there were limits to his comfort.

After Rico’s breakfast, a quick walk in the snow, and a cup of “coffee” for me, I put the tamales in the oven to warm. I helped Alex tie his pink tie and find his nice shoes.

"Here we are. You'll find your preferred name, occupation and year on your door."

She walked into a circular, cozy-looking community room, just the right blend of homely and futuristic, surrounded by four other rooms. The first door tag she read said Sonya ('preferred name'.

The journey to the restaurant was hard for Natalia, as the few borders they had to pass required them to state their names, and origin year (which meant the year they had come from, not their birth year, as Natalia found out the embarrassing way); she struggled to control herself whenever Isaak announced his name.

As many adults are, I was dissatisfied with my station in life. I wanted more. It felt like I’d squandered so many years chasing things that didn’t bring me happiness. I’d been forced by the educational system to pursue a career I didn’t want, I’d had relationships that had crumbled apart whenever I’d given them my all, and the house I’d bought had merely become a noose around my neck. I wished I could shirk all my duties and skip off into childhood again. I spent so many hours fantasising about going back there. Whenever the memories of it became very clear, it felt like I could access them again, like they had returned to the present moment.

I had a feeling of restlessness, like I knew I’d still failed to find the item I was looking for. I didn’t know where that feeling stemmed from. What was it, I wondered, that was driving me to perform my search? It felt like I was hastily hunting for something I’d misplaced, but I didn’t even know what that thing was. Finally, I came upon a box, labelled with my granny’s name. I tore into it and her scent hit me: lavender and musk. It was as fresh as the last time she embraced me. I almost wished I could contain it in that box, keeping it accessible each and every time I lifted the flap. But it was diffusing into the atmosphere of 2023. She had passed away twenty years prior to that, and it felt impossible that her scent could have survived so long, but somehow, it had.

A few hours later, we brought a tray of cakes fresh from the oven. The ingredients were simple, the recipe surprisingly easy to replicate, but we knew they would never be the same as Granny’s. I took a careful bite and the cake melted on my tongue, awakening my tastebuds, and then the unthinkable happened: I was transported. I regained awareness of my surroundings, but whenever I looked down at my hands, they had become dainty, like a little doll’s. I stood in front of the looking glass. I was back in my childhood body. I heard my mother’s voice calling me – crystal clear and lacking the rasp it had acquired with age. I didn’t know how long it would last for, but I hoped I could stay there forever. My life was better in those simple days And so, I kept ravenously eating.

Her blonde-haired assistant shuffled in almost immediately, conjured as reliably as a genie from a bottle. She wasn’t the best assistant Andie had ever had, not yet. However, she had the potential to be. One day. As for now, Rose was essential, and Andie planned on keeping her through the winter.

But there in lived the lie that there was no need to panic, flee, or horde supplies. There was reason. There were billions of them, millions of which lived in the same city as Andie.

“Look, Rose, we’re going to be fine. I’ve read the articles. I’ve listened to the academic reports. The winter will be long, cold, dark, and bitter, but it’s doable. Nature isn’t trying to kill us. We will be fine. However. People can’t be trusted to be rational. They are going to panic. The stores will run out of supplies. If not tonight, for sure by tomorrow. They’ll struggle to stay stocked from here on out. Not because we can’t make enough, but because people will buy them too fast. Therefore, I want you to go buy whatever you need, right now, before people have all day at their desks to fret about the snow sticking and they panic buy on their way home until there’s nothing left.”

Andie sat on the edge of her desk, sighing at the softly swirling snow outside her windows. She would help the others too, though not so blatantly. She glanced at her watch.

Toad rolls to a sitting position, a groan escaping his lips, blinking the heavy traces of sleep from eyes tinted teal like the oceans of legend. The colorful hues a sea used to boast before they turned into a diminished green, spoiled and rotting, or dried out entirely. One that existed in The Old World. A time when the water thrived with marine life and wouldn’t boil a man alive who stepped inside it.

One thing they hadn’t been able to stockpile – others like themselves; humans with damaged DNA called Scavengers. They had only discovered a handful of others. More were out there, scared and alone, fighting for their lives. The chemical changes inside them allowed a fighting chance at survival when banished to the Outer Lands. A place which paid the price for the past sins of men who dared to play God.

The sanctuary is full of his children, all different sizes. Interesting crossbreeds - some of them proving nontoxic and even edible. A genius botanist, the elderly man had configured a way to cultivate plant life with innovative grow lights powered by wind turbines. Deep in the belly of their underground refuge they had struck gold two-fold for the rest of his success; a meager groundwater reservoir, untainted, and a geothermal pocket providing the perfect temperature for plants to thrive.

She’s used to the city and has yet to discover the dangers of life outside it. Hope lights her eyes; a slow simmering hatred for the Inner City blisters Anther’s gut because of it. Why do humans use fear and bigotry to divide themselves? A girl like Yara deserves to be safe. She’s human. Instead, she’s out here with him. Another childhood ripped away in the face of bleak reality.

“You spoil her too much,” Anther says, after closing the door, topside again. He slides a gas mask over his face. An overabundance of caution. Phagos isn’t a death sentence for the likes of him. Still, it's a lot heavier in the air outside the compound versus inside. A heavy dose for a Scavenger all at once can cause a euphoric sensation. It alters their sense of time and place. Hardly responsible when setting out on a mission to retrieve supplies.

Her face isn’t covered, the skin of her arms bare, an exposed unblemished ivory neck. Even a Scavenger wouldn’t be bold enough to brave the outside this uncovered. Terror blazes inside her eyes. A name escapes her lips with fervor. She repeats it, again and again, stumbling further into the Outer Lands.

Ahead of them, the terrain turns mountainous, and the woman disappears into its crevices. She’s still shouting for someone, her voice raw. “Let’s turn back,” Toad says, “No one is going to hear her this far out.” Anther remains silent, only picking up his pace when he hears the woman scream. It’s through a narrow dirt path sandwiched between towering red rocks that he sees what’s happened. She’s calf deep in Oakley River and its blistering her legs.

She looks at Anther, grey eyes churning like the violent skies above them. Her expression is one of fierce compassion. “He’s my brother. Was I supposed to let him fend for himself? Stupid boy,” she spits. “It’s my job to look after him. Not the other way around. I’ve seen the separation happen to other families,” she says, biting her lip. More tears spill down her cheeks. “He’s the only family I have. I'll hide him. I'll find a way to keep him safe. This wasn't supposed to happen to us.”
